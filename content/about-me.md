### Hi ðŸ‘‹

Hi there, I'm Mike.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on big data engineering with Spark+Python on AWS at Nielsen.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about k8s in the small amount of time that I'm not working on my Master's in CS.
- ðŸ¤” I could use help with understanding DeFi and applications on blockchains. No buzzwords, no nonsense - what's real and what's not?
- ðŸŒŽ I occasionally write blog posts at https://mikestaszel.com/.

### Management, Being a Tech Lead, and Software Engineering
I consider myself to be a software engineer at heart. The software I write tends to be backend and data-intensive.
Nowadays I'm trying to do less code-writing and more of everything else:

* Writing READMEs (like this one)
* Writing blog posts (occasionally)
* Reading (yes, actual books)
* Thinking about design patterns and architecture (how do you scale k8s _really_)
* Mentoring and leading a team building products and shipping features
* Hiring (!)

### Stuff I've Worked On
* Django! My first internship and full-time job was at a startup that was built on top of Django.
* Built an Android app for fun. It was much easier than multiple failed attempts of creating an iOS app.
* Machine Learning. Just scratched the surface. Data cleansing and feature engineering really is 95% of the job.
* Built a CHIP-8 emulator. It plays Pong and that's pretty much it. Maybe I'll work on a Gameboy emulator next.
* Spark, Hadoop, Hive. My second job was doing that on Azure. My current job was doing that on-prem, then we migrated to AWS EMR. Now we're running Spark on k8s.
* AWS EC2, EMR, ECS, EKS, Lambda, API Gateway, CodePipeline, VPC, IAM, CloudFormation, and plenty more acronyms. What I currently do every day.

### Everything Else
In my spare time nowdays I chip away at a Master's Degree (OMSCS). I'm more than halfway done, there's no turning back now.
My wife and I enjoy hiking, biking, traveling, and playing with our Shih Tzu.
