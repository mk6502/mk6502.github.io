I love seeing when something I wrote helps someone.

Someone sent me an email _years ago_ thanking me for writing about some obscure bug or problem I solved and blogged about, and I remember it to this day!

[Medium](https://medium.com/) is a popular blogging platform that a lot of software engineers use, and I've started cross-posting there.

### Why Cross-Post?
A picture is worth a thousand words:

![60 claps!](/img/medium-cross-posting-60-claps.png)

That's right - 60 people **found** my post and found it to be **useful** and clapped! That story has 179 views as of right now - that's a great "clap-to-read" ratio.

Would 179 people even know about my personal blog, hosted at my personal domain, with absolutely _zero_ SEO?

You can also choose to monetize your posts on Medium, but I personally don't.

### How to Cross-Post
#### What Not to Do
**Do not simply copy and paste your blog posts from elsewhere into Medium and post.**

There's an easier way that also has SEO benefits.

#### Importing Stories
Rather than copy-pasting stories, use Medium's "Import" functionality: [Importing a post to Medium](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214550207-Importing-a-post-to-Medium)

Not only is it faster - it also creates a canonical link between the Medium post and your external blog's post.

I don't really know the first thing about SEO, so I'll let Wikipedia explain it: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element)

That's all there is to it. Stories on Medium will have a "originally published at" link to your blog at the bottom of the posts. You get the benefits of "owning" your blog as well as the discoverability aspect of Medium.
