If you really want to get into the details of Python and learn about how the language was built and how some of its internals are implemented, [Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1491946008) is the book for you.

Itâ€™s a great book to refresh your knowledge of coroutines, `asyncio`, and other Python goodies.
