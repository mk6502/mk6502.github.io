I'm giving myself a new personal challenge - to write at least one blog post per week, for the rest of 2022.

These posts might be poor quality, but they'll be better than not posting at all.

The motivation behind the challenge is to write more.

I don't have any topics or posts ready to go or pre-written. I'll have to think of something. I'm not sure if this posts counts as one of the first weekly posts.

Since I'm a software engineer, resetting the blog also means that I had to revamp the underlying technology. I switched from Medium to Hugo, but will probably continue to "cross-post" content in both places.

See you in a week (or earlier)!
